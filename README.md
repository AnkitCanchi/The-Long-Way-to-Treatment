# The Long Way to Treatment

**The Long Way to Treatment** is a digital board game that shows how cancer patients face repeated delays before receiving treatment — not because of bad choices, but because of systemic barriers.

Players race to reach **Treatment**, but insurance reviews, paperwork errors, transportation problems, and work conflicts frequently push them backward. Support systems exist, but they are rare.

This game is designed to be easy to understand, emotionally impactful, and grounded in real experiences.

## 🎯 Purpose

Cancer treatment access often depends on factors outside a patient’s control.

This game demonstrates:
- how delays stack unfairly
- how rare support systems dramatically change outcomes
- why reaching treatment should not depend on luck

The system is the obstacle — not the patient.

## How to Play

1. Choose 1–4 players
2. Roll the die on your turn
3. Move along the board toward **Treatment**
4. Follow the instructions on the space you land on

### Space types:
- **Delay**: insurance issues, paperwork, transport problems
- **Support**: patient navigators, paid sick leave, reliable rides
- **Checkpoint**: progress that can still be undone later
- **Treatment**: the goal

The first player to reach **Treatment** wins — but most players will experience multiple setbacks along the way.

---

## Key Takeaway

Even when players make reasonable choices, delays are frequent and unavoidable.

Support systems are powerful, but scarce.

Reaching cancer treatment should not depend on luck.

##  Notes for Judges

This project prioritizes:
- clarity over complexity
- realism over abstraction
- accessibility for all players

The game is intentionally frustrating to reflect real-world barriers to care.
